In order to utilize R effectively, we will need to understand how we can store our data and also how we can assign our data to objects. This lesson will cover:

- How can we assign a value to a object?
- What types of information can we store in R?
- What are the different objects that we can use to store our data in R?

# [Functions in R](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/lessons/03_introR-functions-and-arguments.html)

You will sometimes run into the cases where you want to iterate or make a shortcut of a process in R. One way to do this is to use or create a function. In this lesson we will explore functions, specifically:

- How to use built-in functions in R
- How to create your own custom functions

# [Reading in and Inspecting Data](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/lessons/06_reading_and_data_inspection.html)

Oftentimes when using R, you would like to be able to read in your dataset. In this lesson you will learn:

- What types of data can be read into R
- How to read that data into R
